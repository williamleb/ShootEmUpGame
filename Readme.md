# Shoot 'Em Up Game

This is the third game I made using the C++ programming language. 

In this game, you play as a spaceship from a side view perspective. You must reach the end of the level by avoiding damages, picking up power ups and defeating enemies.

## Additional info

The comments in the code are in French. This is because this game was made in the context of a game development class which required the French language to be used in comments.
